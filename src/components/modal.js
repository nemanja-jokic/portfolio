            <p>My name is Nemanja</p>
            <p>
              Iâ€™m an actor. I'm driving in a van with my fellow workers from
              school to school and performing puppet shows for children. I like
              that job. But a year ago my situation has changed and I was forced
              to stay almost all day at home. I was thinking: "What should I do
              from now on?Which job can enable me to work from home?" So coding
              was the first thing that came to my mind; but as I believed that
              only really smart people can do that, I was a little bit scared
              whether I'm smart enough. But I haven't had a choice. So I started
              leaning to code on the internet...

              <p>This is my presentation</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
