              Iâ€™m an actor. I'm driving in a van with my fellow workers from
              school to school and performing puppet shows for children. I like
              that job. But a year ago my situation has changed and I was forced
              to stay almost all day at home. I was thinking: "What should I do
              from now on? Which job can enable me to work from home?" So coding
              was the first thing that came to my mind; but as I believed that
              only really smart people can do that, I was a little bit scared
              whether I'm smart enough. But I really wanted to try. So I started
              leaning to code on the internet... Over time I found coding a
              really interesting field, where you can express your creativity as
              well. Now I'm really excited about what I've learned and I'm sure
              that I'm the right guy for this job, but I understand that this is
              just the beginning. I want to show you just part of what I've
              learned by now, in these few lines of code which you're about to
              see...
