Professionally I'm an actor. but last year i started learning coding. During this time i've learned basics and more of Front End techs( html ,css,scss, js, ReactJS(Native as well), redux ). I got to the point that in order to progress, i need real projects to work in. I have experience in developing admin dashboard and online marketplace for ticket reseller(FlipTix- 'intership for Oykos Development') and i feel that my skills and abilities with really strong desire to learn more will meet your company's needs.

Sincerely,
Nemanja Jokic
